# Best practices for successful prototypes

#### Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals, datepickers.&#xA;

Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.

But then I found a [component library based on Tailwind CSS called Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/). It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigation bars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

## Getting started with Flowbite

First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the documentation.

It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns, and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.

You can check out the [quickstart guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/) to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you want to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can purge and minify the generated CSS.

You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce pages that can help you get started with your projects even faster. You can check out this [comparison table](https://flowbite.com/docs/components/tables/) to better understand the differences between the open-source and pro version of Flowbite.

### When does design come in handy?

While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototyping will come in handy:

1. Usability testing. Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live;
2. Involving stakeholders. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;
3. Impressing a client. Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea by providing your client with a hands-on experience;
4. Communicating your vision. By using an interactive medium to preview and test design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.
